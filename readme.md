## Dataset

Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.

> The dataset I will explore and analyze in this project is the PISA dataset. The following Note from the udacity website describes the dataset best: "PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy."

## Key Insights for Presentation


> In my exploration I wanted to look at the following questions: 
- How does the immigration status correlate with the students wealth and social, cultural and economical status? 
> The charts show that the native students are on average less wealthy. In the boxplot the median wealth of the native students is lower than of those with immigration background. The multivariate analysis of all three features shows that the students with immigration status either First-Generation or Second-Generation are located slightly more to the top right of the plot. This leads to the assumption that students with immigration background are indeed on average wealthier and have a higher economic, social and cultural status. This is a finding that is rather counter intuitive. The effects are quite little. 

- Is there a difference between academic performances of a students with different immigration backgrounds? 


- Does the immigration status have an influence on the sense of belonging to school?
